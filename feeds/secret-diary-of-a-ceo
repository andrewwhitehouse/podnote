<title>The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett</title>
<description>A few years ago I was a broke, university dropout, living in one of the worst parts of the country, alone, with nothing but a laptop &amp; a dream. Fast forward a few years, I’m the 29 year old ex CEO of one of the UK’s fastest growing companies. That company is called Social Chain. My world is intense, sometimes crazy, always challenging and always unpredictable. This podcast is simple, every week I’m going to share insights with you from guests with different backgrounds, experiences and learnings. I want to give you a look into what it’s like behind the scenes, being an entrepreneur, the deep, dark thoughts that nobody else will share with you and anything else that’s playing on my mind. This is not scripted and I don't have questions I just see where the conversation takes me. This is the diary of a CEO, I’m Steven Bartlett. I hope nobody is listening, but if you are… keep this to yourself.

<div>Professor Green’s accomplishments as a white rapper, at the time he found success, is a staggering achievement. An achievement which, perhaps, wouldn’t be expected from a young guy dealing drugs to get by.</div>
<div>
<br>
So in this clip I ask Professor Green, aka Stephen Paul Manderson, to explain how he found success in his career, and then happiness.<br>

<div>In his first extended sit-down interview, Arun talks to us about how he gives his all to every task he does, how he stays focused, and how his very competitive nature drove him to the top. But he also opens up about the pressures he faces. And he comes clean about how the very instincts that drive him on can make him his own worst enemy. </div>
<div><br>

<ul>
<li>Your early years </li>
<li>Building confidence &amp; practicing gratitude </li>

<div>It seems that in the modern world we live in ‘anxiety’ is a word we are all becoming far too familiar with. The same can be said for many celebrities and online personalities who at first glance may seem untouchable, however when you look a little deeper, no one has it all worked out.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this extremely open and honest clip, Jim reveals how a complicated childhood became the source of many of his issues. He also reveals how he has come to identify and overcome his anxiety for both himself and his new family on the way!</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week we’re doing something a bit different, and telling you everything you need to know about the business of podcasting. Have you ever wanted to know what goes into an episode of The Diary of a CEO? The truth of the relationship with our sponsors, the equipment we use, and where I want this podcast to go. Well, now’s your chance.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This podcast has been an incredible journey, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built. When I started this podcast, it was just me in my bedroom speaking alone into a microphone. Now, we’re the number one business podcast in Europe for over 40 consecutive weeks. Today, we step back to reflect on that journey. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And yet, I’ve found that what inspired me to make the podcast then is the same what inspires me to make it now. I’ve always loved sharing incredible stories with you. I’ve always loved pulling out and sharing those little secrets in how people achieve - and maintain - success. And I still hope nobody’s listening, but if you are, then you keep this to yourself. <br>
<br>
Topics:</div>
<ol>
<li>Consistency </li>
<li>Getting your podcast discovered</li>
<li>Maintaining a high quality of work</li>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Why I started and new reasons to keep going</li>

<div>Talking about sex can often be an uncomfortable conversation for most of us, especially if it includes discussing our issues in the bedroom.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This is why I decided to fire all of the taboo questions we all want to know the answers to at Kate Moyle, a Psychosexual and Relationship Therapist and host of The Sexual Wellness Sessions Podcast.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Ali Abdaal is a first in his class Cambridge graduate who is an expert in productivity and getting the most out of your life. He finished top of his year at Cambridge, but he wasn’t content with mastering productivity in one field: as well as being a full time student, he built a multi-million dollar business, as well as a youtube channel with over two million subscribers. <br>
<br>
Ali manages to squeeze every moment from his day. Yet when you listen to this, you’ll see that the techniques he uses to do this are really simple. He’s learnt them through hard-fought experience, and today he’s willing to share them with us.<br>
<br>
Ali has been a qualified doctor now for three years, and still practices medicine part-time. But he’s spread his wings and still runs his businesses and courses on the side. With so much he packs into his life, Ali is quite simply the best out there at helping you to maximise your productive potential. Today, he opens up like never before to reveal exactly how he does it all, and how you can too. <br>

<div>She has used her knowledge to counsel others looking to build their own businesses, and is the author of three books, the latest being <em>Do What You Love, Love What You Do</em>, about how to turn your passion into profit. We think after listening to Holly’s story you’ll see how anyone can found a successful business, no matter what barriers stand in their way.

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Russell Kane was one of the most surprising guests I’ve ever had on this podcast. Not only is he intelligent and self-aware, but he is also very straight-talking, which is one of the reasons why I believe this ‘moment’ from the podcast is so powerful.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Together, Russell and I were discussing success and what it truly takes to become a successful person. In actual fact, the path to success is a pretty simple one, but sometimes the most simple truths can be the most demanding. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Alex George is a pure inspiration, thats one of the best ways I can describe him, he’s selfless, self aware and just an all round great guy. Having grown up in Nantgaredig, a village near Carmarthen, Wales. He is the oldest of three children. George studied Medicine at the University of Exeter and went on to work in Emergency Medicine at University Hospital Lewisham in London. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In 2018, George appeared in the fourth series of the ITV2 reality dating series <em>Love Island</em>. Following the show, he returned to working part-time at Lewisham whilst also making regular media appearances speaking about mental health on ITV morning shows including <em>Good Morning Britain</em>, <em>Lorraine</em> and <em>Loose Women</em>.</div>
<div>In 2019 George launched his podcast <em>The Waiting Room with Dr Alex</em> in which he interviews other healthcare professionals about topical health and wellbeing issues. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In July 2020, George's youngest brother Llyr died by suicide. In January 2021, George launched a campaign requesting the UK Government prioritise mental health amongst children and adolescents. During Children's Mental Health Week in February 2021, George met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed George to the newly created position of Youth Mental Health Ambassador. In addition, George also became a member of the Mental Health in Education Action Group. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This conversation has it all, its gripping, its open, it’s honest and it had me nearly in tears almost 3 or 4 times. I can’t express to you how selfless and down to earth this guy is but you’ll find that out from our conversation today. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Deliveroo, wow this company is HUGE! I’m sure most of you would have used it but do you know anything about the guy behind it? My guest this week is Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Born in 1979, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, Shu grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. His mother, a scientist, and father, who worked in insurancem. He founded Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend and software engineer Greg Orlowski. <br>
<br>
Deliveroo operated in London for the first two years, growing via word of mouth. It now operates in 12 countries and more than 200 cities. Deliveroo is worth £5 billion, becoming Europes fastest growing company with 2,000+ employees. In mid-June 2016, Will and Greg received an award for <em>the Best Startup Founders</em> as part of <em>The Europas Startup Conference and Awards</em>, mainly given to technology companies. The company also received <em>Fastest Rising Startup of the Year</em> and <em>the Europas Grand Prix award. </em>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by £460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add £372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to £1.5 billion in the year to June 2019.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>By mid 2020, Deliveroo had not benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged. Deliveroo reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Will talks about how hard this decision was that the time in today podcast.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Will is an  incredible entrepreneur, one thats a far cry from the usual braggadocios CEO of a multi billion dollar company. He’s a humble person and lives a very modest lifestyle saying his life hasn’t change much at all since the early days of Deliveroo. This is conversation proved to me that you don’t have to be born an entrepreneur.<br>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Over the last few years I have gradually come to understand why, broadly, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. This ‘secret’ which only the rich possess is something which I learned only when I became rich myself.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this ‘Moment’ episode of my podcast, I’m going to reveal this ‘secret’ to you all, as I explain why the pursuit of knowledge is the greatest decision you will ever make and how cleansing your social media ‘diet’ can vastly improve your chances of success.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest this week is my friend and all round good guy True Geordie, otherwise known as Brian Davis. Brian is from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He was born on a council estate, raised mostly by his mother as he describes his father being in and out of prison and not really being the father figure he desperately needed. When Brian left home he went to work on the oil rigs, scuba diving to work on them underwater. He describes how this would put him into life or death situations on a daily basis. The colleges he gained on the oil rigs became his father figures.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After leaving the oil rigs he started YouTube under the name footballfan533, and first rose to prominence when his first video (titled <em>A True Geordie's view on Nile Ranger</em>) went viral. Brian quickly gained a following due to his expletive and passionate opinions, and therefore changed his channel name to <em>True Geordie</em>, uploading more regularly. He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous <em>True Geordie Podcast</em>, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna. Geordie was chosen the host and commentator for the KSI V Joe Weller fight in February 2018. He had previously been a commentator for some of the charity football matches. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I met Brian back in 2017 to record his podcast, we recorded it in a tiny abandoned bomb shelter that he paid £50 a day to rent out. Brian has come a long way since then, running a rapidly growing Youtube channel thats accumulating millions upon millions of views per week, he’s commentated on one of the largest Youtube events in history and he’s also created some of the best content I’ve ever seen. All of this was quickly ripped away from him last year after one of the hardest weeks of his life, something we talk a lot about today. He’s gone through it all, been to the darkest of places, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. However this didn’t stop him getting back on his feet and rebuilding himself from the ground up, coming back bigger and better than before. </div>

  <title>E86: Monzo CEO On Death Threats, Depression &amp; Digital Banking Wars - Tom Blomfield</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Tom Blomfield, wow what an entrepreneur. This guy has founded multiple multi-million-pound companies, that have become monumental disrupters in the industry. And let’s face it, Monzo, one of the companies Tom founded and led, is the one of the most forward-thinking, innovative, fastest-growing companies there is. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Tom was born in Hong Kong and lived with his father and mother. His father was a business-minded civil engineer and his mother was an artist. When Tom was a child, he moved to London to attend grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire then moving on to study Law at Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, at the age of 21, he co-founded <a href="http://Boso.com">Boso.com</a> an “eBay for students”. After a few internships with law firms he decided being a lawyer wasn't for him and followed the entrepreneurial journey instead. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In January 2011 Blomfield co-founded the UK-based company GoCardless, an automated payment method that processes Direct Debit payments on behalf of other businesses and organisations. Blomfield stayed in Silicon Valley during his three years at the company, it raised around £35 million of investment and hired 100 people. When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a "very small share" in the £50-100m valued company) Tom moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Following his departure from Grouper Social Club Blomfield joined Anne Boden’s Starling bank as the CTO. Startling was, at that point one of the first digital banking companies. Tom left the company in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that "he could not comment under the terms of his departure". Today we learn about what really happened at Starling.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo, operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online In its first fundraising round, the company raised "£1 million in 96 seconds”. In April, Blomfield announced he would forgo his salary for one year to help his company during the COVID-19 pandemic In May, he announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Monzo and taking on the role of president of the company. In January 2021 he announced he was leaving the company permanently.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This conversation today takes us through Tom’s wild entrepreneurial journey expressing the highs and lows of running a business. He also talks about the disagreements at Starling bank and ultimately his reason for starting Monzo in the first place. His stories are unique, and more importantly honest. Unbelievably honest. He tells you the mistakes he made, his deepest insecurities, his biggest challenges and the things he wish he knew. Wow this is a good one.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>At the time of recording this episode, I had been in a constant loop of feeling motivated to go to the gym and get in shape for the summer, then slowly seeing that motivation die off by the time the summer had passed.</div>
<div><br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest this week is Mary Portas. You may know Mary from the high street, from business, or you may know her as the red bob, hard exterior business woman from the TV. In this conversation today I saw a very different one to the one I’ve seen in the media. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Mary Portas is an English retail consultant and broadcaster, known for her retail and business-related television shows, founding her creative agency Portas and her appointment by David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, to lead a review into the future of Britain's high streets. She’s worked in various retail roles: John Lewis and Harrods, Topshop. Then creative director at Harvey Nichols – which was her rise to fame. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In 1997 launched an agency called Yellow Door producing campaigns for clients including Clarks, Louis Vuitton, Oasis Stores, Swarovski, Dunhill, Boden, Thomas Pink, Patek Philippe and Mercedes-Benz, Sainsbury's, Habitat, Westfield, Liberty and The Body Shop. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In 2013 she re-launched her agency as Portas Agency Ltd. Today, Portas Agency advises retail clients from every continent, and the businesses success is built on an obsessive understanding of human and cultural behaviour. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Today she’ll talk about an idea thats fairly radical to some people, especially people that are building or have built big businesses which is based on her new book ‘Rebuild: How to thrive in the new Kindness Economy’.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This conversation incredible, Mary is hilarious, she is smart and she is kind. On top of all that her brutal honesty blew me away which is a central part of what we spoke about, the idea of being true to yourself or facing the inevitable of ending up in disappear. Mary’s been a public figure, a media star, she’s faced public scrutiny but through it all she’s emerged as this levelled headed, down to earth, warm hearted individual. I laughed, I realised and I was deeply inspired and you will be too.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this clip, Jake Humphrey explains that understanding the ‘building blocks’ to success is what truly made him successful. He claims the ‘trick’ is to take absolute responsibility for everything in your life.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Jake then tells us that now that he has his success, it feels somewhat underwhelming and anticlimactic as he reveals that he doesn’t yet ‘feel’ successful.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Liam Payne has been subjected to the intensity of the spotlight from the age of just 14, when he found global fame following his entry in to the X Factor’s seventh series, and the dizzying rise once he exited as one fifth of the group One Direction. The band was cemented as a phenomenon overnight-their success and the surrounding hype was likened to that of a modern-day Beatles at time of their debut single release. They became the first UK group ever to have their debut album reach number one in the United States. There probably are not many who are better placed than Liam to discuss instantaneous fame and the churning of its 'machine’.  <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Liam has gone from a teen star to a fully-fledged solo artist who has taken ownership of his career in terms of its creative direction and elevated further with a strong signature pop/rnb style and a string of hits both here and abroad. He’s had his music streamed over a total of 2bn times. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>However, there is much more to him than the image of simply being a teen heartthrob or sugary popstar. The X Factor may be notorious for churning out ‘instant’ popstars but Liam clearly has a deep appreciation for music and the process behind its production. He studied as a musician prior to the start of his mainstream career and has grown as a gifted songwriter, with 40+ writing and co-writing credits to his name. He has previously said that he is accustomed to writing and recording entire albums in six weeks or less, and his evolution on personal and creative levels has no doubt been accelerated by his exposure.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This conversation today isn’t your normal “reunion chat” we speak about so much in a lot of depth, everything from his relationships, his darkest times and everything in-between. Its open, its honest and its inspiring. During our conversation Liam mentioned it was one of the best chats he’d had in a while and I felt that, I hope you do too.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This podcast is a real treat and a podcast that you cannot miss!<br>
<br>
Johann has come back and what honour it was to record. He has to be my all-time favourite guest ever! His book ‘Lost Connections’ had such a positive, transformative impact on my life and truly changed my perspective on how I viewed depression &amp; addiction. I am sure that the information shared today will be valuable and important topics that our society needs to hear. <br>
<br>
Johann is a very successful and inspirational British-Swiss writer and journalist with 2 books hitting The New York Times best sellers list. Born in Glasgow Scotland then relocated to London when he was young, Johann experienced some childhood trauma having suffered from being physically abused as child and his mother suffering from an illness.<br>
<br>
Starting his career as a journalist he won many awards such as Journalist of the year and was named by the Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people. Johann then went to onto being an author writing the worldwide known “Lost Connections” and “Chasing the Scream”. He also released a TED talk back in 2015 “Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong” which has now over 17 million views.<br>
<br>
This honest conversation lasted around 2 hours and we even went on into the evening off air. I genuinely think that this might be the most important podcast you choose to ignore.<br>
 <br>
I’m not giving much away, but you will thank me after.<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>Why do you like writing books? </li>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Ben Fogle, a TV presenter broadcaster and author who has reached the peak of Everest, trekked over Antarctica and rowed across the vast Atlantic ocean.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>We all know Professor Green aka Stephen Manderson for his multiple chart topping songs throughout the years but there is so much behind each and every track inspired by his rocky upbringing, to say he has faced and overcome adversity to reach where he is would be a real understatement. He was born and raised in Hackney, growing up on one of the most notoriously troubled council estates at the time. He has won a number of personal battles ranging from health trauma and poverty to parental abandonment. Stephen's mother gave birth to him at 16 years old and left him and the home when he was just one year old. His father was absent for the vast majority of the time, leaving Stephen troubled and alienated. He was raised by his nan Pat.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Stephen was stabbed in the neck in a near fatal attack with a broken glass bottle in a Shoreditch nightclub when he was 26. Convinced that he would die, he fled the club in shock and phoned both his mother and grandmother to say 'goodbye'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In 2008, Stephen tragically lost his father to suicide by hanging. He opened up on this is in his pivotal documentary 'Suicide and Me' released in 2015 for BBC III. They had had a difficult relationship prior and only occasional contact -he had not seen him face to face for six years before to having to identify his body, and his last words to his father had followed a bitter argument. <br>
<br>
In 2017, Stephen had a major health crisis and ended up with “a paralysed stomach”, totally unable to digest food. He managed to heal himself in large part through his own research and combinations of gut/balancing products. Since identifying a gap in the market for similar solutions through his own health battle, he has converted that newfound knowledge and research into co-founding liquid supplement company Aguulp, its product range receiving rave reviews so far.<br>
<br>
Stephen is incredibly level-headed and self aware despite treading such a rocky path. His constant battle with mental health both personally and within the family has created a mindset that is very unique and this conversation is one that I think everyone needs to hear.<br>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this episode I look back on a trip I took to India where I got to take a look at what life is like in the slums of Mumbai. This entire experience shifted my perspective completely and yet the most surprising thing about what I was seeing wasn’t the grim reality of poverty, but the unshakable fact that these people were happy.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I walked away from those slums with an entirely new perspective on the privilege we have been given from birth, and this is where I introduce how I discovered a more grateful perspective</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>As entrepreneurs we all have a clear vision for what we want and who we want to be. But no matter how strong this vision is, procrastination and distraction somehow find a way to stand between us and getting stuff done.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In these ‘Moment’ episodes I will be selecting my favourite sections from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this episode Journalist and Author Johann Hari, most well known for writing the New York Times bestselling book ‘Lost Connections’, explains why as humans we are becoming less happy and more lonely.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>As a species, we are becoming more and more disconnected, and Johann mainly puts this down to the fact that we are being driven by ‘junk’ values. Like junk food, our ‘junk’ values seem to be attractive to us, but really only go on to harm both us and our happiness.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Johann explains that only once we begin to understand our intrinsic and extrinsic motivations will we finally be free to live a more connected and happier life.<br>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Growing up on an Estate in Peckham, Rio’s parents encouraged his curiosity. Many of you, may not know, Rio danced ballet to a high standard before choosing to pursue a career in football... and well, you might think you know how the story goes. You don’t. In this open, intimate and honest conversation Rio talks about his achievements, failures, successes and how his life experiences have made him the father he is today.</div>

<div>Rio respectfully won 6 Premier League Titles and 14 Trophies. Rio announced his retirements from professional football on 30 May 2015.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After retirement Rio has joined BT Sport as a Pundit. The BBC one documentary - Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The documentary won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Rio is a special guy, not least for what he’s achieved but for who he is, and today. You’re going to find out who he actually is. The philosophy to life that he swears by, and the culture required for you to win in an ambitious career, but also the culture required to win in your personal life.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Jack Maynard is a British YouTuber who is best known for his parodies, vlogs and collaborations with other famous YouTubers including Joe Sugg, Oli White and Caspar Lee. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Jack’s Youtube channel took off extremely quickly, amassing a following of 1.5m subscribers on his main channel since 2015. He is also the younger brother of Conor Maynard, a singer-songwriter and musician who shot to fame after being spotted on YouTube aged 15, and Anna Maynard who is a popular influencer, singer and YouTuber in her own right.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>At 23, he was the first YouTuber to appear on ITV’s 'I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!' (2017). He found himself embroiled in a scandal when he was removed from the show after just three days over tweets he made in 2011. This left Jack facing public scrutiny, being part of a British cancel culture moment, events which would change him forever. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After various struggles as a result of ‘I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here’ Jack returned to TV screens with an appearance on Channel 4’s 'Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins' in 2020 to help him overcome what he’d been struggling with for the past three years.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Grace is an entrepreneur, brand founder, influencer and Oxford University graduate who defied expectations and took her post-grad journey in an unexpected direction by launching 2 major brands: [We Are] TALA (sustainable, slow fashion activewear label) and fitness app Shreddy. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>TALA’s performance since its launch in 2019 shows it to be one of the biggest positive disruptors in the gymwear space both in the UK and overseas. At the core of the brand is a focus on ethical, eco-efficient manufacture practices. The designs are inclusive in terms of size and shape range: Grace has spoken of the importance of personalising your fitness and health journey rather than subscribing to what's most popular or promoted on social media etc. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Grace has remained outspoken on the challenges faced by women in business, even in 2021. A social conscience runs through all three of her companies: up-cycled offcuts and recyclable materials are incorporated into products from TALA while remaining available to consumers at affordable prices. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Grace also used to vlog her daily life with great success, sharing her ups and downs as a 20-something year-old. Longtime subscribers of hers have had the chance to join her on a more personal journey. She however stepped away from vlogging a year ago to pursue her business ventures.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Grace launched both Shreddy and TALA within a month of her final university exams. She is frequently discussed by followers for her drive and ability to be able to take on multiple projects at once with tons of enthusiasm. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Shreddy has received widespread press coverage since its launch, and Grace has recently pulled off a major partnership with celeb/influencer Jordyn Woods in LA, as well as collaborations with brands such as KOI footwear (an exclusive line of vegan footwear released in 2019). <br>
<br>
- How did you have the confidence to pursue such an uncertain career </div>
<div>- How does it feel being discredited for what you've done? </div>
<div>- Sacrifice of business  </div>
<div>- Your mental health</div>
<div>- Relationships as a young successful woman<br>
- How has being a successful person changed you?  </div>
<div>- Your take on working culture </div>
<div>- By stepping back from social media did you let the negativity win? </div>
<div>- What area of business are you best at? <br>
- What area of business are you bad at? </div>
<div>- Instagram </div>
<div>- Any big regrets?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>From an early age Ben was subjected to a violent parent relationship which saw his family break apart, with only his mother to defend both himself and his brother. Through severe bullying and family upheaval, he moved home six times and went to six different schools within ten years of his life. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After an unfortunate incident as a nightclub bouncer involving the death of a patron, Ben fell into a world of drug abuse, gambling and addiction, balancing on the brink of life. Broke, with no home or anyone to turn to, he abused his addictions every day and battled suicidal thoughts. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Ben saw an advert on YouTube for the Royal Marines and knew he had one chance left at life by joining. Joining the marines gave him a purpose, he trained religiously, day and night to get fit and read and revised military tactics to increase his knowledge.  And he didn’t have a single hand in getting clean from the drugs – his mind, determination and sheer drive got him clean – he was thinking differently.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>During his ten years with the Royal Marines – one of the most elite regiments in the world, Ben travelled the world, seeing active operational duties in Afghanistan. The Corps was a rollercoaster journey involving the extreme highs, and lows of war. After being injured in an IED blast in Afghanistan, he returned to the UK with the horrors of war still imprinted on his mind. He had to stay at home with his thoughts – now in a completely new battle.  He turned back into his old self before the marines, drinking, gambling and getting in trouble. The dark thoughts were intrusive. After one alcohol fuelled event, Ben was court-martialed and sent for trial; with his first son on the way he was staring at a four-year sentence for assault, but he fortunately escaped prison by a judge who took pity on him.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Broken and at his wits end, a friend lent him ‘the chimp paradox’; and he found himself immersed in self help books and receiving treatment for PTSD. Like a breath of fresh air, his life changed almost instantly. Ben finally found the answers from experts to understand his behaviour.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>When his demons were brought under control, he was given the opportunity to join the Commando training centre in Lympstone. As a recruit instructor, he entered the world of coaching and helping others; which saw him flourish. As a result of his ability, he ended up working with the England football team, where the next part of the journey begins. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After being medically discharged, he now owns a leadership and performance coaching company, Vanguard and Find Your Edge, that helps organisations achieve their goals by employing a new mindset; working with many elite professional sports stars, and elite businesses to achieve more. <br>
<br>
<br>
Topics:<br>
- Your Childhood</div>
<div>- The desire to be an alpha male</div>
<div>- An incident that changed my life forever</div>
<div>- My turning point - joining the Royal Marines</div>
<div>- How to find that purpose</div>
<div>- What the commando mindset?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest this week is an inspiring woman and a brilliant leader, Fran Millar.<br>
<br>
Fran was recently appointed CEO of the UK fashion brand, Belstaff. Prior to Belstaff, Fran was the former CEO of Team INEOS (formerly Team Sky), the world famous cycling team. Fran led the development of the team’s operational and governance systems alongside all of the business and engagement strategies. Fran has been with team INEOS from the very beginning and during this time she has played a key role in the successes and gained considerable experience in all areas of the team.<br>
<br>
She previously held a dual role as both Director of Business Operations and Head of Winning Behaviours at Team Sky. Returning to head up all the team’s ‘off bike’ functions in 2015, her responsibilities included overseeing the team’s marketing and communications strategy, stakeholder management, and all the commercial and legal aspects that come with running the world’s number one cycling team.<br>
<br>
Fran worked alongside the incomparable Sir Dave Brailsford for over a decade, as well as leading sports psychiatrist, professor Steve Peters.<br>
<br>
Prior to working at Team Sky, Fran set-up and ran her own successful athlete and event management agency for 7 years, initially representing her brother, David Millar and going on to represent some of the UK’s highest profile cyclists, including 2011 Sports Personality of the Year winner Mark Cavendish and  2018 Tour de France winner and 2018 Sports Personality of the Year winner, Geraint Thomas.<br>
<br>
During her career in cycling, Fran had to deal with some tough challenges including getting caught up in tan infamous doping scandal that involved her pro cyclist brother David. <br>
<br>
Fran’s story is a fascinating one, one that has twists and turns, one that would have left a lot of people behind but not Fran. Fran is tough, she’s tenacious, she’s inspiring. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest this week is kayaking legend Anna Hemmings MBE. Anna is Britain’s most successful female marathon kayaker with a staggering eleven World and European Championship medals, 9 of them gold. By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport.<br>
<br>
Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong. At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.<br>
<br>
Anna’s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year.<br>
<br>
This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I’ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up. We also delved into her expertise in resilience and high performance, discussing the steps she takes to help people become the greatest version of themselves. <br>
<br>
This weeks topics:<br>
<br>
- Why Kayaking?<br>
- Why you?<br>
- Healthy conflict within teams<br>
- Key lessons from your psychologist <br>
- How do people overcome their limiting beliefs?<br>
- What do you think about this idea of labels?<br>
- Your process of visualisation<br>
- Your discipline and how to apply it  <br>
- How do you find what drives other people <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It’s coming to that time of year when everyone starts to reminisce about the year that has just been and thinks about the changes they can make to have a better, happier future...<br>
<br>
The thing is though, this year has been different to any other that has gone before! It’s been difficult, it’s been a struggle, it’s been heartbreaking! <br>
<br>
Within the hard times of life we tend to learn more about ourselves and who we are. For that reason, I’ve decided to host a two part end of year special podcast episode to take a look back at the biggest lessons I’ve learnt during one of the hardest year of our lives and how we can try and make 2021 a better year.<br>
<br>
Topics:<br>
- 2020 - Learn to live while we can<br>
- Productivity hack of 2020<br>
- Create a sense of urgency <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode I sat down with the man who is putting British boxing on the map, Eddie Hearn. You’ll probably know him as a confident, boisterous, loud promoter. But when you dig a little deeper, I found something else, something much more revealing, something that made me unsure whether I should feel sorry for him, or be impressed by him. During our discussion he shared so many pieces of valuable information from his journey climbing to the very top of the business ladder… and he isn’t finished yet!<br>
<br>
Topics:<br>
- What made you so relentless </div>
<div>- The sacrifices in-order to be successful </div>
<div>- Deathbed thinking</div>
<div>- Is ambition choice?</div>
<div>- Finding the work life balance for a relationship </div>
<div>- Your experience with mental health</div>
<div>- Social media</div>
<div>- I don't like being a celebrity </div>
<div>- Selling Matchroom</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week's episode of The Diary of a CEO is all about the certainty of unexpected chaos. This is a different episode, for the very different times that we’re living in. But, I think you ALL need to hear this, because I did.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>I discuss why you should be responsible for your actions, how to be positive amongst all the chaos, stay psychologically effective and the importance of being compassionate with your thoughts.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>I also delve into what I call "happiness dividends" and discuss why it is vital not give up on your long term goals for short term pleasures, especially in this time of uncertainty.<br>
<br>

  <description>In my most recent episode of The Diary of a CEO, I sat down with the incredibly successful TV presenter, journalist and entrepreneur Jake Humphrey.

Jake has gone from being an unqualified drop out, who was fired from McDonalds after just two months for a lack of communication skills to one of the UK’s most well known TV presenters, with accolades such as CBBC, BT Sport, Formula One and much more. Jake also co-founded the production company Whisper Films, alongside former BBC Sport producer Sunil Patel and David Coulthard and the business has grown from £1.5m to almost £20m.

Our conversation was extremely honest and open. Jake has struggled to come to terms with the common misconceptions of who he is, battling suicidal thoughts and developing an unhealthy relationship with social media. We discuss the best way to move forward with the devastating impact social media can have and why failure is the key to being successful.</description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode of The Diary of a CEO, I chat to Dame Stephanie Shirley also known as "Steve".</p>
<p>At the age of 5, Steve fled from Nazi persecution in her hometown of Dortmund and arrived in the UK on the Kindertransport, luckily escaping the Holocaust.</p>
<p>As a female, Jewish immigrant who wanted to create a software company, the stacks where naturally against her. However, she was determined to succeed and with only £6 in her pocket, she taught herself how to code, created an empowered, female dominated workforce and grew her business so at the time of sale, it was worth £2.3bn.</p>
<p>Our conversation was inspiring. Stephanie was doing things 50 years ago that companies are struggling in do in 2020, and this was at a time where females couldn't even open a bank account without their husbands permission.</p>
<p>We discussed success, how money is correlated with happiness, facing adversity plus much more. I have taken some nuggets of wisdom from her that I can use in my business life so I am CERTAIN you will learn things as well.</p>

I discuss how we are obsessing over optimising our lives and the worrying increase in loneliness within the “internet generation”.

Nir released his first book in 2014 “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” and it became a Wall Street Journal International best seller, with over 200,000 copies sold worldwide.</p>
<p>5 years later, Nir has released his second book “Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life”. Nir's highly researched and in-depth insight is fascinating and we discussed all about the science of distraction. Nir explains why we’re constantly distracted by things around us, especially social media notifications and how we can break our tech addictions in order to finally get stuff done.</p>
<p>I was so enthralled with Nir's advice and I absolutely think you will be able to use some of his suggestions as actions in your every day life. I know I certainly will. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Brothers, best friends and business partners, The Heaton Brothers share more than just their parents. George and Mike Heaton are the founders of the world-renowned streetwear brand, Represent. The 26 and 28 year old initially started Represent in their Dad’s shed in the back garden, before quickly taking over this and moving to the garage, to the kitchen, and then the whole house until they made enough money a year and a half later to move to their own place. Having been in business for 5 years, their annual turnover increased from £1.8 million in 2014 to over £8 million in 2018 and their brand is now stocked in over 160 outlets including Harvey Nichols and Selfridges, hosted on global catwalk shows and worn by the likes of Dua Lipa, the Kardashians and Justin Bieber. In this episode of The Diary of a CEO, we discuss how hiring your best friends can work successfully in a business, the importance of a strong work ethic, how to deal with mental health in a high pressured job and the future of the fashion industry.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks solo episode of The Diary of a CEO, I discuss how important it is to build and share your story when creating a brand or a business. I talk about how we are naturally obsessed with being motivated and ambitious, and explain how being motivated by external incentives could potentially hinder your passions. I also debate whether living a restrained life might actually be more beneficial for us. Finally, if you think that you might experience imposter syndrome or are often floored by procrastination, then this podcast is a must for you!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since we last spoke which I apologise about! In this week’s episode of The Diary of a CEO, I discuss how a bad reaction of mine lead to a lot of regret. We are all on a journey of self-development and in this particular moment my ego showed up. I also talk through the concept of consistency and why I believe this is one of the most important attributes of greatness. Finally I discuss how caring less about the opinions of others will equal more success. Some of us are unable to distinguish between people pleasing and personal passion and I truly believe that one of the bravest things you can do in 2019 is be your true-self. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>From co-CEO of Badoo, a dating-focused social network worth over a billion, to sitting on the advisory board for Bumble to launching her in own app in 2017 with co-founder of Deliveroo Greg Orlowski, Michelle Kennedy is a force to be reckoned with. She is the Founder of Peanut, an app that connects like-minded women who happen to be mothers. Her aim? To help solve a problem for women who are entering the massive, life-changing and sometimes lonely experience of having a baby by finding them a trusted, friendly support network. Combining everything she knows about dating and romantic relationships, Michelle brings a unique perspective to her work, and in just 3 short years her app Peanut has had over 10 million messages shared, 100m profile views and has over 650k users. In this episode of The Diary of a CEO, we discuss the loneliness of founding a business, the challenges of getting investment as a women and mental-health issues that can arise as a result of the all-consuming story of entrepreneurship. I found this conversation with Michelle incredibly inspirational, and I hope you do to. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I spoke with Alan Barratt, CEO and Founder of the worlds fastest growing sports performance and weight management brand, Grenade. Alan and his wife Juliet started Grenade in 2010 with just £27 in their bank account. After a few short years, 50 new members of staff and retailing in 80 countries around the world, Grenade is now worth a whopping £72 million and is one of the most exciting companies in the United Kingdom. Alan is an incredible CEO with an amazing success story. In this podcast, I learnt about his heartbreaking sacrifice, his underdog-style narrative, and gained some serious life lessons that only someone in this position could ever of shared. Alan gave me a new perspective on what matters the most in life and is a true inspiration. I hope you enjoy listening to this podcast as much as I enjoyed recording it. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Chapter 9 of The Diary of a CEO. This week, I talk about my obsession with the tragic yet fascinating mess that is Brexit, and how I’ve learnt more about British politics in the last 3 months than I’ve known in the last 10 years. Through this, I came to the realisation that algorithms are running my life and how important it is to fill your feed with value. I talk about mental health; how getting carried away with labelling our regular emotions as disorders is dangerous, as well my new personal endeavour ‘Project Peri’ - more of this in the episode. I discuss my belief that everything in life DOESN’T happen for a reason and how this belief will impact you negatively and follow from this with 6 key ways I've found that help turn a bad situation into a good one. Finally, I would like to mention some sad news from last week. Kate McIver, a truly incredible woman passed away suddenly after a battle with terminal cancer. Our thoughts are with her family and friends. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks episode of The Diary of a CEO, I sat down with Tobi Pearce, the CEO of SWEAT. Tobi describes SWEAT as the world’s biggest online digital gym, offering help and guidance for women with their fitness choices and health goals. Australian-born, Tobi had quite an unconventional start to his adult life, choosing to move out at 16 due to struggles at home. He started off working in a music shop before turning to personal training, where he met his now fiance Kayla Itsines - known for being one of the biggest online fitness influencers in the world. Their first business was born in 2014 and after a few years transformed into SWEAT. After several years of incredible global success, Tobi and Kayla are now worth an estimated $46 million, with a dedicated community of more than 20 million women around the world using SWEAT, making it one of the highest grossing apps on the iTunes store. Tobi travelled to meet me in the Social Chain New York office and we discussed everything from the concept of being in control of your destiny, the importance of communication, fearing failure and obsessing over progress. I really enjoyed this chat with Tobi and I hope you do too. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>It has been a crazy few travelling weeks for me so I do apologise about the delay in this episode. This week, I discuss the culture of winning. Some people have an ingrained ideology that they will always lose. This is learnt from previous failings, actions when we were younger and negative team mentality and I talk about how small behaviour changes can help us modify this way of thinking and switch to a winning mindset. I also chat about feelings of progress in life, and how lack of progress can lead to feelings of unhappiness. We are a generation focused on destinations and we have a tendency to mark major achievements as milestones that define our lives when instead, we should be focusing on the journey. Some horrible news this week also lead me to discuss the importance of looking after our friends, especially the ones who mask their pain. We need to remember to treat the people around us with a certain level of caution, as nobody truly has any idea what other people are going through. Enjoy.</p>

In this episode I chat with journalist and author Johann Hari, most well known for writing the New York Times bestselling book ‘Lost Connections; uncovering the real causes of depression and the unexpected solutions - one of my favourite books to date. I've wondered for years why mental health issues are on the rise, why people are lonelier than ever and why anxiety is so prevalent amongst young people, and this book helped me find those answers. Raved about by the likes of Elon Musk and Hilary Clinton, I recommend it to absolutely everyone I meet. I travelled to London to meet with Johann and discuss all things mental heath including<b> </b>the concept of intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation, the idea of dedicating time each day to becoming happier and how to address mental health and wellbeing in the workplace. Our conversation was inspiring, eye-opening and life-changing. I hope you find this too. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week has been chaotic. In Chapter Five of The Diary of a CEO I flew back to the UK for an incredibly busy week filled with podcast interviews, speaking appointments, pitching to one of our biggest clients as well as filming an advert campaign. The chaos of this week lead me to thinking about the concept of burnout and the fact that right now, we are the burnout generation; the generation constantly trying to become more efficient so that we can free up time to then fill with things that make us more busy. We are the generation that has replaced quality time with things that take less time... more of that in this episode. I also discuss our need for control in life and why we need to assess what really matters. If we truly think about it, there is only one thing that we can be 100% certain of, that is inevitably going to happen to us all...We should stop caring about strangers opinions and sweating the small stuff and instead focus on what makes us happy. Lastly, I talk through our need for rules. We are always looking to apply rules to our lives that we should follow in order to achieve success in what we want. But we are all different, and following rules set for other people is a dangerous game that can only lead to one thing... failure. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Diary of a CEO, my entire perception of what an entrepreneur is, is completely turned on it's head. I travelled to a beautiful house in the LA hills to meet with Tom Bilyeu, the founder of Quest Nutrition. In 2014, Quest Nutrition became the second faster growing company in North America with it growing 57,000% in the first 3 years and hitting $105m in sales. Tom never wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I was intrigued to find out what changed him. How did he go from not even having the drive to get out of bed in his 20's, to being worth an estimated $400m. Tom's latest venture, Impact Theory, is a non-profit media company with an aim to end the poverty of a poor mindset. He has amassed millions of followers online and is helping inspire people to change worldwide. Tom is one of the most humble and selfless entrepreneurs I have ever met. I learnt so much in this podcast and I know you will too.  <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In Chapter 3 of The Diary of a CEO I talk about the importance of trusting more. I am a real perfectionist and feel trapped between wanting to control even the smallest details and wanting to let go and delegate. I touch on learning to say no, which I think is one of the single most important things you can ever learn. Saying no and focusing will define you as a person. Karma is also a big topic in this episode alongside unlearning the bad things, the manifestation of fear and why I'm thinking of getting therapy. </p>
