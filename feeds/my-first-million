      <title>Greatest Hits #7 - Revisiting The Idea Episode with Product Genius Scott Belsky</title>
      <description>On this episode, Sam (@theSamParr) gives an update on one of Shaan's favorite episodes, his interview with Scott Belsky. Sam revisits what Scott said a little over 18 months ago during episode #32, and shares his thoughts on Scott's ideas today. Grab another salad, this is a good one.
#32: We've got a different flavor today for you. We sat down with Scott Belsky (@scottbelsky) join us today and instead of hearing his backstory, we bounced around a bunch of topics. Scott has done it all. He's been a founder (Behance), angel investor (Uber, Pinterest), VC (Benchmark), Tech Executive (CPO of Adobe currently), and Author (The Messy Middle). So sit back, grab a salad (cause we're healthy in 2020) and enjoy this conversation.

      <title>#187 - How Vending Machines are Generating Millions, The Next Big Social App &amp; Ghost Kitchens For Gifts</title>
      <description>There are entrepreneurs quietly generating six figures working part-time in the vending machine business. Others have been able to scale to multi-million and even multi-billion-dollar figures in the industry. Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) break down the vending machine industry with tons of numbers and exactly how some are pulling it off. The guys transition from a "boring" business to high-tech ones as they break down how Vimeo went from a College Humor project to competing with YouTube and earning an $8b valuation. They also talk about a trendy new pod that generated 500k downloads on its first day and they brainstorm on a fun concept: ghost kitchens for gifts.

      <title>#182 - How an Astrology App Makes $10m+, Why a Boxing Announcer is Worth $400m &amp; Creating a Personal Monopoly</title>
      <description>Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) talk about an astrology app that has been creating controversy throughout Silicon Valley -- Sanctuary. VCs have come out against the app as pseudoscience, but the guys question their logic. These kinds of apps go into the bucket of "me-businesses" or businesses that tell the user about themselves. So from there, the guys brainstorm on ideas within this framework. The second half of the episode is focused on "personal monopolies" -- the concept of creating a big personal brand and monetizing it. We talk about a few people who have done it successfully and how you can too.

We've talked about this business before, and Shaan even said it was one of the best ideas we've had on the pod. We also cover BeeRoll (Shaan thinks this can become a 9-figure company), Polymarket, and a bunch of growth tactics at the very end.

      <description>Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) are joined by Furqan Rydhan (@FurqanR). Furqan was Shaan's CTO at Bebo and previously co-founded AppLovin -- a $20B+ company that recently went public. Shaan and Furqan host a weekly "Cool Sh!t Hour" between themselves to discuss the coolest innovations Furqan's seeing. We basically took that and made it into a podcast. Furqan talks about mind-control hardware, vertical farming, and a lot of interesting crypto projects. He also talks about what it was like starting a multibillion-dollar company and his mindset around making decisions on what projects to work on.

      <itunes:summary>Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) are joined by Furqan Rydhan (@FurqanR). Furqan was Shaan's CTO at Bebo and previously co-founded AppLovin -- a $20B+ company that recently went public. Shaan and Furqan host a weekly "Cool Sh!t Hour" between themselves to discuss the coolest innovations Furqan's seeing. We basically took that and made it into a podcast. Furqan talks about mind-control hardware, vertical farming, and a lot of interesting crypto projects. He also talks about what it was like starting a multibillion-dollar company and his mindset around making decisions on what projects to work on.

      <title>Greatest Hits #2 - How to Build a $100 Million Deodorant Business Starting With Only $1,000</title>
      <description>Shaan (@ShaanVP) talks to entrepreneur Moiz Ali (@moizali) on today's episode. Have you ever looked at the back of your deodorant stick and read the ingredients? Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex? PPG-14 Butyl Ether? Well, Moiz saw that and created Native, a natural deodorant without all the chemical junk. He built the company from his brother's dining table - doing sales, marketing, operations &amp; customer service as a one-man-show. His hard work paid off, as he sold the company for $100M to Proctor &amp; Gamble just 2.5 years after it launched. Listen in to hear the backstory of how he started using just $1k, how the company almost died (twice), and how he negotiated a $100M sale of the business!

      <title>Greatest Hits #1 - Turning it Around: From Failure to a $100m+ Success</title>
      <description>Suli Ali is one of the most interesting founders we’ve had on the pod.
Suli and his brother Moiz have started and sold $300m worth of companies. They’ve also invested in hundreds of big-name startups, thousands of real estate deals, and much more more.
He built small, silly apps. Like a Facebook app survey where you voted “most likely to wear a bunny costume”. Yet...it turned into a huge success. How?
When he sold his first company, it was doing $85 million in revenue and $15 million in profit.
In this episode, we discuss his journey from making $76k a year at Microsoft to selling his first company for $100,000,000+.

* 27:25 - Getting grilled by Keith Rabois
* 41:25 - Listen to Suli’s confidence and how he explains starting stuff and how he deals with downs.
* 1:02:25 - Risking his life savings to make his company work (then selling it for $100m).</description>

      <title>#177 - How a City Tour is Making Millions, Selling Manhood &amp; the Barstool for Tech</title>
      <description>Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) might have set a record with this episode in terms of ideas! We start with Shaan laying out his case for why a "Barstool for tech and business" would work and how it should be done. Sam pushed back a little bit but admits it's possible. The guys then talk about the booming software course business. Valuations are sky-high for some companies in this sector -- Shaan explains why. The guys also revisit internal media companies (they'll invest if you're doing it). The guys also break down: a NYC tours business pulling in $1m annually, "Manhood as a Service" businesses, and renting chickens!

      <title>#176 with Codie Sanchez - Buying Distressed Assets, Real Estate for Cheap &amp; How to Network Like a Pro</title>
      <description>Codie Sanchez (@Codie_Sanchez) joins Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) for this brainstorm. Codie is all about businesses that cashflowing right away. She talks everything from buying distressed businesses to modular homes to buying real estate for pennies on the dollar. She doesn't shy away from controversial thoughts either: she lays out why angel investing is dumb and why public stock investing is as well. We end the episode with some great stories on "how to collect people" (basically network like a champ) and what financial freedom really means.

      <title>#172 - Indie Businesses Making Millions, Advice to Young Entrepreneurs &amp; How to Grow a Podcast</title>
      <description>We start this one off with a little "Inside MFM" from Shaan (@ShaanVP) and Sam (@TheSamParr) as they discuss growing the pod and how they are going to do it. Then they break down the big news of the week: the Coinbase IPO. They talk about Coinbase's humble origins on HackerNews and how most big businesses have these same origins. It's often hard to see the big picture in the early days. They also talk about their own early days and give advice to young entrepreneurs. The second half of the pod turns into a brainstorm. They brainstorm around indie businesses like Microacquire and Photopea and how to build similar businesses. Finally, we end it by discussing the opportunities around "Affirm for X".

He thinks he can be the next Jay-Z or Dr. Dre, bridging an entertainment career with a successful business one. He's already had a hit with Fanjoy, which he breaks down for us. Jake also talks about his investment philosophy, some of the companies he's investing in, and the areas he's most interested in at the moment.

Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) answer your questions:

(3:40) What are you both investing in?

(16:16) Please update us on your rolling fund. Is it what you expected? Are you more or less bullish on it?

(21:25) What do you not get a chance to talk about (either because it's off-topic/lower priority) that you wish you could?

(23:08) You guys are awesome at coming up with incredible ideas and knowing how to execute them. What would it take for one to pull you out of Twitch and want to pursue in full force?

(27:24) Shaan how do you balance side hustles while still outperforming at Twitch?

(33:06) Who’s the worst person you admire?

(39:29) Should you hire your friends?

(44:19) Who can squat more weight?

(44:40) What are the biggest insecurities, both of you struggle with?

(48:30) Since covid is pretty much a thing of the past...when will the MFM meetup be?

      <title>#160 - Paid Communities Making $20m+ (and How to Build One), Fighting Inertia &amp; An Interview With Dave Selinger of Deep Sentinel</title>
      <description>MFM #160

The guys breakdown paid communities

Why paid communities are good businesses:

You can make them kinda fast (much faster if you have an audience)

Fun to run if you like the interest

Don’t need a lot of start-up capital and can have a lean team

Quite profitable

Cons:

Churn can be high

Likely can’t scale to me huge

Won’t get better with size necessarily (if user content-driven, deal-driven, or otherwise, more can be better. If connection related, less is better)

Seem challenging to sell if there’s a leader

To make a successful community:

The amount of money you’ll make is directly proportional to the amount of revenue the members will make being connected to each other multiplied by the amount of people who’d sign up.

Enthusiasts of RC cars? Likely don’t make much value from it, so you can’t charge a lot. But if it’s huge (and get better with size) then can work

Underdog, us vs them, united interests, info that wants to be private, highly disjointed online, 


Communities the guys like:
Tiger21: A peer group for people above with a net worth of at least $10m. 


Numbers: It boasts ~850 members. They generate revenue through a $30,000 membership fee and also run ads to its members. Do an estimated $24m at least in sales

Sold to private equity recently


Why join?: Learn and make connections.

Evanta

Was known as CXO Acquisition Co. and Sports Leadership Acquisition Co...so maybe started in sports?

Evanta derives most of its revenue from event sponsorship. Event sponsors pay a fee to advertise at each event with pricing dependent upon the quality and level of executive attendance.

121 Unique communities worldwide 6,500 Participating organizations 253 C-level programs across 10 countries 83% of Fortune 100 represented 18,000 Participating C-level executives 87% companies with revenue of $1B+

Sold for $275m in 2016 to CEB and then Gartner

Had $17m in cash when bought

12x income...so made $23m in profit!

SoleSavvy

A SoleSavy membership provides you the tools and resources you need to successfully purchase the products you want for retail (starting with sneakers)

Raised $2m

Started as a Slack group (the waitlist for the group grows by 400 people per day)

5,000 members. They charge $33 a month so $160k MRR

Cook groups. AK Chef is a big one. 2000 ish members at $50.

NurseLifeRN

Instagram meme page with 1.2m followers

BALA (a shoe for nurses company) uses this as the main advertising channel.

Shaan predicts these niche communities can launch brands and hold equity in companies who need their captive audience to grow.


Inertia

Shaan explains inertia:


Are you doing what you are doing just because or does it make you happy and are you chasing what you actually want

      <title>#159 - Update on Michael Jordan's House, a Nine Figure Sex Toy Company &amp; the Man with a Million Acres</title>
      <description>MFM #159

MJ house update


Recap: Last episode the guys spoke about buying MJ’s house. The plan was to potentially turn it into a museum or Airbnb.


Problem: zoning and parking -- but those might be overcome 

Shaan: Spoke to Rally Rd and Nifty Gateway founders 


Now what: What's going to happen now?

Sam thinks nothing’s going to happen -- the guys are too busy. Shaan: you’re afraid to fail


Collecting old Apple computers


Opportunity: Old Apple computers like the Macintosh II and Apple II sell for a premium on eBay. There is still demand for these because of their cool aesthetics, and retro look.

At Monkey Inferno, visitors would often ask about their old Macs over the expensive paintings that hung on the walls.

Sam bets these will continue to appreciate. Can make for a good investment opportunity as retro style becomes more and more in demand. 


Idea: Creating products from old Macs, such as https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/03/Macquarium-jake-harms.jpg 


Sex talk


Steve Shubin - founded Interactive Life Forms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleshlight



Origin: Steve started creating sex dolls, but eventually realized most guys wouldn’t order sex dolls. He pivoted and created the Fleshlight. He scaled the company with his kids.

Does an estimated $50-$100m in revenue


Sidenote: One of Fleshlight’s factories in Spain uses its excess capacity to manufacture prosthetics elephant legs for Southeast Asia


Opportunity: Creating the new fleshlight

There is a growing demand for male sex toys, especially in countries like India and China. Even in areas where it’s taboo, new discreet packaging has made it easier. 


Idea: Fleshlight marketing through channels like Onlyfans. Molds can even be made from the Onlyfans creators themselves.


Billy of the week

Brad Kelley

Started out renting space for factories and warehouses. When he noticed lots of customers using his warehousing space to store tobacco, he pivoted. 

He founded Commonwealth Brands in 1991 and sold it in 2001 for $1B

"I've never defended [smoking]. Hopefully, it will be phased out of society."

He’s bought a ton of land since then and is now the 4th largest landowner in the US.

In January 2020, Kelley put up for sale many of his West Texas ranches, offering roughly 500,000 acres with a listing price of $404 million.

He also bought Lonely Planet installing a 24-year-old CEO at the helm

The purchase was a failure when he sold the company in 2020 for $50m having had bought it for $70m

Sam’s a fan

Keeps to himself and has done “boring” businesses. In contrast to Silicon Valley’s flashy hype-machine


Indie VC


Indie VC was a venture firm backing mostly bootstrapped founders. The idea was to give founders a little bit of money to help them grow instead of the traditional model of flooding a company with cash and taking a massive stake.

The company closed its doors, and Shaan and Sam are critical of how founder Bryce Roberts announced the closing (didn’t take the blame hard enough). https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09

      <title>#158 - Buying Michael Jordan's House (and Making a Profit), Investing in Athletes &amp; Successful Startup-Studios</title>
      <description>MFM #158

Andrew Chen story

University of Washington has a program for gifted high schoolers who want to do college early. Andrew took part and graduated at 19.

He met some pretty cool people doing this including emmit of twitch, and head of hedge funds.

Shaan got into a Duke program as a teenager via TIP program by scoring high on PSAT. Shaan: This is a great marketing trick -- he’ll do this when he starts his school

For athletics, the opposite is done.


MJ’s house

Michael Jordan’s Chicago home went on sale for $30m many years ago, but hasn’t sold. Today it’s on sale for $14m.


Idea #1: Buy the house using crowdfunding and through NFTs, any fan can own a fraction of the property. From there, the property can be turned into a museum.


Idea #2: Instead of turning the house into a museum, turn into a great Airbnb. Obama’s Hawaii house (the Plantation Estate) rents for $6k a night or $180k a month.

You have to make it the dream “man cave”/sports fan getaway. Make it an alternative to Vegas for bachelor’s parties. Fill the house with Jordan memorabilia, and make it an incredible experience for fans to come to.


Famous homes: There's a precedent for taking famous homes and turning them into museums. 


Graceland: Elvis’ former home receives 600k visitors each paying ~$30


Painted Ladies: Painted Ladies and “Full House” house are mainstay attractions. “Full House” house sold for a premium above market price. 


Counter: Sam is sceptical of crowdfunding on Rally Road because of the difficulty in liquidating. Shaan counters by saying fractional ownership makes liquidity less of an issue. Also many aren’t concerned about selling. Would rather wait and hold.


Big League Advance


BLA: Offers cash to minor league baseball players with the promise of making money if the baseball player hits it big.

Fernando Tatis Jr: Took cash when he was in the minors from BLA, but now has to pay out ~$30m after signing a $300m+ deal


Opportunity: Baseball is the easiest to model, but the NBA presents a great opportunity because of guaranteed contracts. If a player gets a $100m, 5 year deal, you can offer them $80m upfront for the contract. Instead of 


Counter: This is a risky business. The business only works if you can model properly and get big hits to cover the losses.


Startup studio

Instead of investing in companies or starting just one company, startup studios invest and incubate several businesses at once.

Shaan: Historically very tough and didn’t work. Garret Camp, Mark Pincus, Kevin Rose, and Michael Birch (Monkey Inferno where Shaan worked) all had studios which had no big winners.


Successful studios: The tides may be shifting as a few studios have begun getting hits. Thrive Capital by Josh Kushner (Oscar), Atomic by Jack Abraham (Hims), Prehype (Barkbox and Ro)


Atomic: Only works at one project at a time and the team has 9 months to raise a series A or else may be out of a job. Also focused more on B2B than consumer.

eFounders: European studio that only does SaaS. They’ve been able to make the model successful


Kevin Ryan: Part of DoubleClick when it was sold. Made about $20m and created AlleyCorp which incubated companies like MongoDB, Business Insider, Zola and Guilt.


Good: It’s a dream job because you work on multiple ideas. Unlike a traditional startup, when failure happens you can just move onto a new project as a team


Bad: For a startup to work, you need laser focus. Often what happens, when a startup hits a plateau, you can pivot to an area that’s working. At studios, the team is more inclined to move onto another project altogether. No do-or-die, back-to-the-wall mentality as with startups.

BLA: Offers cash to minor league baseball players with the promise of making money if the baseball player hits it big.

Fernando Tatis Jr: Took cash when he was in the minors from BLA, but now has to pay out ~$30m after signing a $300m+ deal


Opportunity: Baseball is the easiest to model, but the NBA presents a great opportunity because of guaranteed contracts. If a player gets a $100m, 5 year deal, you can offer them $80m upfront for the contract. Instead of 


Counter: This is a risky business. The business only works if you can model properly and get big hits to cover the losses.


Startup studio

Instead of investing in companies or starting just one company, startup studios invest and incubate several businesses at once.

Shaan: Historically very tough and didn’t work. Garret Camp, Mark Pincus, Kevin Rose, and Michael Birch (Monkey Inferno where Shaan worked) all had studios which had no big winners.


Successful studios: The tides may be shifting as a few studios have begun getting hits. Thrive Capital by Josh Kushner (Oscar), Atomic by Jack Abraham (Hims), Prehype (Barkbox and Ro)


Atomic: Only works at one project at a time and the team has 9 months to raise a series A or else may be out of a job. Also focused more on B2B than consumer.

eFounders: European studio that only does SaaS. They’ve been able to make the model successful


Kevin Ryan: Part of DoubleClick when it was sold. Made about $20m and created AlleyCorp which incubated companies like MongoDB, Business Insider, Zola and Guilt.


Good: It’s a dream job because you work on multiple ideas. Unlike a traditional startup, when failure happens you can just move onto a new project as a team


Bad: For a startup to work, you need laser focus. Often what happens, when a startup hits a plateau, you can pivot to an area that’s working. At studios, the team is more inclined to move onto another project altogether. No do-or-die, back-to-the-wall mentality as with startups.

<li>Michael Jordan’s Chicago home went on sale for $30m many years ago, but hasn’t sold. Today it’s on sale for $14m.</li>

<strong>Idea #1</strong>: Buy the house using crowdfunding and through NFTs, any fan can own a fraction of the property. From there, the property can be turned into a museum.</li>

<strong>Idea #2</strong>: Instead of turning the house into a museum, turn into a great Airbnb. Obama’s Hawaii house (the Plantation Estate) rents for $6k a night or $180k a month.</li>

      <title>#157 - Instagram Food Drops Making $200k a Week, Chrome Extensions That are Crushing It &amp; Open Salaries</title>
      <description>MFM #157



Rewarding hustle: MFM is hiring two kids to do video production because they took the job without permission. They heard Sam complain about needing a recording studio and offered to do the work https://twitter.com/DylanJardon/status/1366274333858017282?s=20. 

This is how you get the job you want. Don’t send a resume. Do the work instead. Don’t ask for permission.


Food topics


The food companies of Instagram: Companies mycookiedealer.com, 1-900-Ice-Cream, and Allie’s Banana Bread are crushing it on IG with food drops that sell out in seconds.


Why it’s big: These work because it’s at the intersection of many trends: cloud kitchens (no need for expensive restaurant infrastructure), DTC (no need to get costly distribution deals and shelf space) and have virality baked into them.


My Cookie Dealer is estimated to be doing $200k per weekly drop. This is a potential $10m business today.


Formula: Sam breaks down how these companies are going viral, and how you can copy.

Make a side ingredient the main thing (cheese, cookie dough)

Make it in an unusual color (rainbow bagel, rainbow kettle cork, green ketchup, cloud bread)

Make it huge (huge sundae, massive pizza cookie, sushi-rito, massive KitKat)

Frankenfood: combine two different foods (cronut, pancake cereal, donut cereal, cream cheese, bell pepper, desert burger, ramen burger, spaghetti donuts, fairy bread)

Food allergy or remove stuff from it (vega ice cream, Banza)

Make junk food or simple food ultra-fancy (tater tots, mozzarella sticks)

Tiller money


Spreadsheet plugins: The guys have talked Chrome plugins and browser extensions in the past, but an overlooked niche is spreadsheet plugins.

Plugins are great businesses because they are sticky and capitalize on an existing platform and user base. They can be light, simple tools that can gain huge adoption quickly. 


Tiller Money (https://www.tillerhq.com/): Personal finance nerd Sam loves the simplicity of this plugin. Most people already manage their money on a spreadsheet, Tiller Money just makes it easier to do so.


Supermetrics (https://supermetrics.com/): Marketing data plugin Sam uses. He predicts the business does 8-figures in revenue.


Open salaries


Open salaries: Should companies publish employee salaries? Open salary data is becoming a legal requirement, starting with 🍃 Colorado: "From 2021 employers must disclose pay rates or ranges in job postings for jobs that could be worked in Colorado (including remote)" Source


Open salaries is part of the culture of some companies. Buffer used it as a growth hack. The company continues to publish a lot of it’s financials and all employee salaries.

Companies doing it now:

Glassdoor shows average and anonymous salaries but can be inaccurate They were acquired for $1.2B in 2018. At the time did $170m in revenue with 700 employees 

Founded by Rich Barton (we’ve spoken about him a few times before). Famous for saying “Information wants to be free”. Started Zillow, Expedia, and Glassdoor off this principle.


Levels.fyi: A helpful guide to understanding what employees at top tech firms should be making. They even help you negotiate a salary. 


Take: Open salaries tend to benefit employees (more transparency means higher, more equal pay) and is more detrimental to employers.

Apple stopped doing it. Buffer has also said it’s not helpful anymore and was only good for initial growth.


Pat Flynn published his income for several years, but eventually stopped as he started getting hate.

      <title>#156 - David Segal Talks Building a 9-Figure Tea Business, Decommoditizing Boring Products &amp; The Future of Retail</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/-156-davidsegaltalksbuildinga9-figureteabusiness-decommoditizingboringproducts-thefutureofretail</link>
      <description>Sam Parr (@TheSamParr), Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and David Segal (@_davidsegal) discuss: David’s background - At 26, David teams up with his 70-something-year-old cousin, Herschel Segal, to start DAVIDsTEA. - Herschel had made his fortune in Canada’s fashion industry. Previously Davis was helping his Herschel make small investments. Together they saw an opportunity to grow a tea brand, where David led and Herschel invested - He made his first million when a Boston PE firm (Highland Capital) made an investment in DAVIDsTEA. - When the company went public it was doing $30m in EBITDA. He didn't want to sell shares at the time, but needed to in order to make the IPO big enough. He eventually left the business and sold his shares because of management issues. He sold at an average of $14 a share. - Today he runs a few businesses. One of which is a restaurant where he is trying to mix the best of ghost kitchens with a sitdown restaurant - David is currently trying to get back in the tea game. He sees an opportunity to make tea good, and cool again. Tea penetration is tiny in NA, so there is a lot of room to grow. - With his new brand he wants to do DTC business by keeping tea simple, but widening its appeal. - Previous to DAVIDsTEA, he ran a software business. It was essentially an abandoned cart business but for real life. Brainstorm - Idea: good video for online meetings is like what a nice Italian suit was in the 80s. It shows professionalism and class. Sam mentions he is willing to pay thousands to have someone create a turnkey video conference setup for him. He thinks this could be a great business opportunity. - Made Renovation (https://www.maderenovation.com/ founded by Roger Dickey) offers turnkey bathrooms. The idea is clients can select from a limited amount of pre-selected styles. Shaan suggests applying this same idea to video conferencing setups. - Idea: Uber for contractors. David suggests it’s hard finding reliable contractors, and there may be space for a company that can help organize the market better. - Modsy: For $500 per room, Modsy provides an on-demand interior designer. They will create a layout and make suggestions for furniture to use. - The guys discuss several “experts on-demand” companies. Companies like Intro.co, GLGinsights.com, Clarity.fm &amp; Officehours.com all do similar things in different ways: connect users with experts on a variety of topics. - Idea: Decommoditizing everyday stuff. By taking an everyday item and adding a unique element to it, you can charge more and differentiate an otherwise commodity. David brings up Duraflame. Duraflame is a fast lighting fire log. The company does 9 figures in revenue but hasn’t been innovated upon in years. Homesick Candles successfully innovated on candles by adding regional scents and creating a differentiated product. Eric Ryan built his career doing this with Method, Olly, and Welly. - Idea: Firelogs with scents. Decommoditizing a boring product like fire logs with a viral and catchy twist. - Idea: “...For dummies 2.0”. The “...For Dummies” were a popular series of books educating anyone on any topic. Both David and Shaan are bullish on doing the same for complex modern topics like blockchain or NFT. But doing so through viral videos. - Idea: Using stores as showrooms. David nearly started a company just like this. It’s a massive opportunity for whoever can figure out how to make use of retail space in a way that makes sense in the ecom age. A company doing this is b8ta. - Smart Center: David mentions Smart Center and other REITS have been big winners during the pandemic, by converting abandoned retail space into apartments, senior living etc. - WGSN (https://www.wgsn.com/en/): A subscription service that helps businesses understand the biggest trends in just about every sector.

He sold at an average of $14 a share. - Today he runs a few businesses. One of which is a restaurant where he is trying to mix the best of ghost kitchens with a sitdown restaurant - David is currently trying to get back in the tea game. He sees an opportunity to make tea good, and cool again. Tea penetration is tiny in NA, so there is a lot of room to grow. - With his new brand he wants to do DTC business by keeping tea simple, but widening its appeal. - Previous to DAVIDsTEA, he ran a software business. It was essentially an abandoned cart business but for real life. Brainstorm - Idea: good video for online meetings is like what a nice Italian suit was in the 80s. It shows professionalism and class. Sam mentions he is willing to pay thousands to have someone create a turnkey video conference setup for him. He thinks this could be a great business opportunity. - Made Renovation (https://www.maderenovation.com/ founded by Roger Dickey) offers turnkey bathrooms. The idea is clients can select from a limited amount of pre-selected styles. Shaan suggests applying this same idea to video conferencing setups. - Idea: Uber for contractors. David suggests it’s hard finding reliable contractors, and there may be space for a company that can help organize the market better. - Modsy: For $500 per room, Modsy provides an on-demand interior designer. They will create a layout and make suggestions for furniture to use. - The guys discuss several “experts on-demand” companies. Companies like Intro.co, GLGinsights.com, Clarity.fm &amp; Officehours.com all do similar things in different ways: connect users with experts on a variety of topics. - Idea: Decommoditizing everyday stuff. By taking an everyday item and adding a unique element to it, you can charge more and differentiate an otherwise commodity. David brings up Duraflame. Duraflame is a fast lighting fire log. The company does 9 figures in revenue but hasn’t been innovated upon in years. Homesick Candles successfully innovated on candles by adding regional scents and creating a differentiated product. Eric Ryan built his career doing this with Method, Olly, and Welly. - Idea: Firelogs with scents. Decommoditizing a boring product like fire logs with a viral and catchy twist. - Idea: “...For dummies 2.0”. The “...For Dummies” were a popular series of books educating anyone on any topic. Both David and Shaan are bullish on doing the same for complex modern topics like blockchain or NFT. But doing so through viral videos. - Idea: Using stores as showrooms. David nearly started a company just like this. It’s a massive opportunity for whoever can figure out how to make use of retail space in a way that makes sense in the ecom age. A company doing this is b8ta. - Smart Center: David mentions Smart Center and other REITS have been big winners during the pandemic, by converting abandoned retail space into apartments, senior living etc. - WGSN (https://www.wgsn.com/en/): A subscription service that helps businesses understand the biggest trends in just about every sector. </p><p>See</p>]]>

      <title>#155 - NFTs Explained: How Digital Art Is Being Sold For Millions and What the Opportunities Are</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/-155-nftsexplained-howdigitalartisbeingsoldformillionsandwhattheopportunitiesare</link>
      <description>Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) discuss: Negotiation as a Service (NaaS) - The guys talk about (and maybe invent) a new category of business: negotiations as a service. The idea here is that there are certain big ticket items where a professional can negotiate a better price for the end consumer. - Incentives matter, however. For a Realtor, getting a client a better deal isn’t always in their best interest. A better model: the negotiator gets a designated percentage if they are able to negotiate below a set price. - Idea: Applying a better incentive model to real estate or home financing. Paying a skilled negotiator a fee for reducing your interest rate can result in thousands being saved annually. - Idea: Salary negotiations for both employee and employer. NFTs - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique crypto tokens. Unlike say, Bitcoin, they aren’t mutually interchangeable -- each token is unique. In other words, NFTs are collectible. - NFTs have exploded in recent months. One site, https://cryptoslam.io/ (also https://defipulse.com/), tracks the daily transactions of different NFT. The top NFT, NBA Top Shots, does $46m worth of digital art transactions daily. - Shaan 10xd his money on the following piece in a matter of days. https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x8ae06a29a816580cbd069e460dd57c6c964bb3da/7500010105. - This piece alone https://cryptoslam.io/cryptopunks/mint/6487 sold for over $1m. - Artists like Eminem and shows like Rick and Morty are created pieces of content that’ll be sold as NFTs. - Logan Paul made $3.5m in one day selling nfts https://beincrypto.com/logan-paul-raises-3-5-million-in-one-day-from-nft-sales/. - Opportunity: When a goldrush is happening, sell shovels. Shaan and Sam think the shovels here are displays. People are buying NFTs, they are going to want to display them. The options at the moment are frames like https://infiniteobjects.com/ and https://www.netgear.com/home/digital-art-canvas/. On the pod Shaan estimates you can sell 300-400 frames and easily generate $5m in a month. - https://opensea.io/: Another marketplace for NFTs. This is the eBay of NFTs CoinMarketCap - CoinMarketCap is a displayed of crypto prices. It's a simple idea that has been working. - When they delisted South Korean cryptos without warning on Jan. 7th, the move wiped out $100 billion of total crypto asset market value. - They were acquired for a rumored $400 million. The company only had 36 employees. Check out today's sponsor: Ourcrowd. They make it easy to invest in early startups. Go to ourcrowd.com/thehustle to get started.

      <description>Today we hang out with Sophia Amoruso (@sophiaamoruso), founder of Nasty Gal &amp; Girlboss. Her story is bananas. She is a community college dropout who created a company that at its peak was valued over $400M+. She has had highs (sold over 500k copies of her book) &amp; lows (nasty gal eventually crumbled) and we talk about both. I was pretty blown away by her honesty. She wasn't trying to make herself sound good or look good (which ironically, made her sound/look great to me). We start with some fun topics like The Bachelor &amp; her favorite cars she's owned (2:23), About her background and businesses (4:45), The story of Nasty Gal: $30m revenue, Index putting $50M investment and her selling life changing secondary (6:44), Expectations after raising venture capital (11:31), Starting conference businesses (15:54), Being a starter vs. operator (17:16), Downsides of being the CEO (20:52), How she got her book to sell 500K copies (24:54), Her investment portfolio of startups and funds (29:17), What's in store for her in the next 10 years? (32:45), Freemium vs Subscription for content (37:13), Opportunities and trends she's seen in the media + retail space (40:06) and Sam's great book recommendation with a horrible - How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis (43:27) Today's ep is possible because of Superside!

      <title>#65 - Q&amp;A with Andrew Wilkinson, Co-founder of Tiny </title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/-65-q-awithandrewwilkinson-co-founderoftiny</link>
      <description>Today we have Andrew Wilkinson (@awilkinson) of Tiny. Tiny is a holding company started by Andrew that buys “wonderful internet businesses” with the intention of holding them forever (akin to Berkshire Hathaway). Altogether, Tiny’s businesses do high 8-figures in revenue and employ close to 400 people across 20 companies. If you want to know more about his background, Andrew was interviewed on our podcast so give Episode #63 a listen. Today he answers: How do you find CEO's that you can trust, You've mentioned Warren Buffet a lot, any other leaders you look up to?, Is “company building” a repeatable process? What % of it can be automated?, Can you recommend your favorite business books?, What is your biggest failure and what did you learn from it?, What is a core attribute you look for when you hire somebody?, How do you make connections with other entrepreneurs while residing in a non-startup centric city?, How much of your investments are made up of personal capital vs. OPM (Other People’s Money)?, During your time at MetaLab, what was the best way to acquire clients?, Are you taking Buffett's advice and reading 500 pages a day?, As a person, how have you evolved over the years?, How do you start a fund with money made from an agency?, What's the required mindset shift from running one business to delegating a team to run multiple?, If you internalize one principal into your kids, what would it be?, When you built your house, what are some things that could have made the frustrations easier?, Can I skip building an agency and go straight into investing? and What's the worst &amp; best advice you get from people who tell you how to become successful?.

      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/datingappthathasanadmissionsprocesslikeharvard</link>
      <description>** In our Facebook group yet? We hang out there so come join and let's talk ideas: www.facebook.com/groups/ourfirstmillion ** Amanda Bradford (@amandabradford) was 28 years old, in business school and using dating apps. She got tired of stalking every match on Linkedin, Facebook etc.. to see if they were legit. Why doesn’t the dating app do this for me?So against all her advisors advice, she started a dating app called the League that checks your Facebook &amp; Linkedin to verify that you are who you say you are.Strange idea, but It’s kinda working! They have over 100k paying members, profitable &amp; been around for 5 years. We talk about: how she got her first 400 users at launch, how they figured out if people would pay $$ for subscription and what the future of dating looks like.

      <title>#39 - Getting a Billion People Working From Home </title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/gettingabillionpeopleworkingfromhome</link>
      <description>We interviewed the founder of Rev.com (they transcribe audio into text), to hear how he built this into a $206M (to be precise) business. We used them to transcribe the My First Million podcast episodes, and realized how badass of a service this was. Super simple concept - create a workforce (currently 50,000) that works remotely, transcribing audio from podcasts, conferences, meetings etc.. into text, for less than $1 per minute. Jason talks about freelancers making money in their pajamas, why they opened an office away from Silicon Valley, the impact of AI on remote work, working for free to show your worth, buying his domain for $400,000 and a clever way come up with and test a killer startup name.

      <title>#35 - King of Kickstarter</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/kingofkickstarter</link>
      <description>Shaan sits down with Peter Dering (@peterdering), Founder &amp; CEO of Peak Design, maker of beautiful, highly functional redesigns of photography equipment. He quit his construction job and traveled the world with $25K in savings. After awhile, he found it to be a pain in the ass carrying his camera around with him. So he thought of a camera holder clip that’d go onto your bag strap. Next thing you know, he filmed a kickstarter video to accompany his simple yet revolutionary product and within 90 seconds of launching he had his first sale. Bags, tripods, straps. Almost every year Peak Design releases some sort of iteration of an outdated piece of equipment and it SELLS. Last year they employed 38 people and did $70m in revenue. He owns 100% of it. Like I said, you want to be this guy. He talks about the process of how you actually create a physical product from scratch, how to work with international distributors, why and how he structured a public benefit entity, how to offset business carbon footprint and how much it ACTUALLY costs (it's tiny!). Have a listen to learn how to kickstart your own carbon-neutral Kickstarter empire.

      <description>The Hustle's My First Million presents: Million Dollar Brainstorm is back. Host Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and The Hustle CEO Sam Parr (@theSamParr) sit down and discuss what side hustles, trends and big business ideas that's keeping them up at night.

Today Sam kicks it off by telling some of the most promising technologies he found at CES 2020, meeting some D2C guys and being astounded by their insane growth rates, the 3 bro's shamelessly knocking off US startups and getting rich, how lucrative trade shows/membership programs/courses can be, why compliance education packages could sell for $$$ to large companies &amp; Shaan reflects on his decade goals and talks about what he wants accomplished by 2030.

      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/pioneeringtheno-codemovement</link>
      <description>We're back with Season 3, brought you by Microsoft: The latest episode of My First Million, Shaan sits down with Vlad Magdalin (@callmevlad), Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Webflow: a visual tool to build web apps. Vlad shares the several attempts in 6 years to get his no-code brainchild going. Persistence paid off as it quickly got to $20MM in revenue and raised a monster $72M Series A round led by Accel. He talks about the emotional rollercoaster of getting into Y-Combinator, the video that made him quit his high paying job immediately, kickstarter kicking him off their platform and the trick to get investors interested without changing anything.

      <description>We've got a different flavor today for you. We sat down with Scott Belsky (@scottbelsky) join us today and instead of hearing his backstory, we bounced around a bunch of topics. Scott has done it all. He's been a founder (Behance), angel investor (Uber, Pinterest), VC (Benchmark), Tech Executive (CPO of Adobe currently), and Author (The Messy Middle). So sit back, grab a salad (cause we're healthy in 2020) and enjoy this conversation.

      <title>#31 - The Wild Wild West of Mineral Real Estate</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/thewildwildwestofmineralrealestate</link>
      <description>Mike Brown is my new hero. He's an ex military man, who came back &amp; built a super lean business (5 employees and 10's of millions in revenue annually) - hired best friends and brothers to share the experience. Mike Brown (@mb_abides) and his gang went on a mission to buy small pieces of real estate from hundreds of families because they were potentially (and quite literally) sitting on a gold mine. They'd then package them up and sell it to the big oil &amp; gas funds - which meant tens of millions of dollars for them. The business part is good - but I love the philosophical and practical advice around optimizing for quality of life. Let me know what you think! Puri.shaan@gmail.com

      <title>#27 - 10 Million Reasons Why He Plays Poker</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/10millionreasonswhyheplayspoker</link>
      <description>Faraz Jaka (@FarazJaka) is a Poker pro who’s made $10M on the felt... What started out as a fun game during his spare time in college turned into big money FAST. Turning a few hundred dollars into $180k in 6 months as a 19 year-old. He was on top of the world appearing in articles, throwing massive parties, flying to Vegas every other weekend and ambitious plans to make millions a year… until it all came crashing down, went into debt and battled depression. Obviously, he rose from the dead and became hugely successful, so join this roller coaster story on My First Million, and also listen to how he uses the “+EV” method for all decision making, why you shouldn’t be results orientated, meditation exercises to overcome stress and tackling depression by confronting your issues like ‘folding a rug’.

      <title>#25 - Mission Driven: Bringing Solar Power to 1M People in Africa </title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/makingmoneyonamission</link>
      <description>He's not on a mission to make money, quite the opposite. Xavier Helgesen is a mission driven founder, who uses money to do more good in the world. His first company, Better World Books sells 10 million used books a year that's collected by leftover books at libraries - in and shares revenues with literacy partners (Over $25M given to non-profits). This business lead him to Africa, where he noticed 20,000 people in a village had no electricity - so he decided to change that. He created Zola Electric, the largest solar power company in Africa, providing 1 million people with electricity per day. He talks to us about how he turned his college side hustle into a $70M biz, moving next to his customers in Tanzania, selling electricity to people who never used electricity and how ‘Mutual Improvement Societies’ could help you 10x your life.

      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/reinventingtheautograph</link>
      <description>The infatuation of Celebrity is something we can all relate to and Steven Galanis (@Mr312) is making sure to take opportunity of that. When was the last time you got a celeb to sign something of yours? Nowadays you'd grab your phone in a heartbeat to snap a pic and share it on the gram or "it didn't happen". Steven built Cameo so you can just pay your favorite celebrity to say (almost) whatever you want. And it's becoming huge. It's a great story that I think you'd love to hear.

      <title>#18 - The Big Business of Wacky Domains</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/thebigbusinessofwackydomains</link>
      <description>Ever wonder who owns all the internet domains like .com, .co, all the way to goofy domain names like .george and .plumbing? Well it turns out, many of these are owned by billionaires &amp; big companies. Our hero today - Sheel Mohnot (@pitdesi) created an online auction site (like Ebay, but instead of selling beanie babies, he auctions off internet real estate). He has hosted $100M+ worth of auctions, keeping a 4% cut for himself along the way. Hear how he found this wacky niche, got the auction platform off the ground - and how he went from living on $1/day in India to becoming a self-made millionaire.

      <title>#15 - Dr. Iman's Incredible Idea</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/imansincredibleidea</link>
      <description>Iman Abuzeid (@ImanAbuzeid) just finished raising $15M for her nurse hiring platform Incredible Health which was led by Silicon Valley's premier venture fund Andreessen Horowitz. Growing up in a family where everyone (literally) were doctors, she naturally followed the same path. Except when she finished medical school and received her MD, she decided not to work as a doctor for even 1 day and went corporate. After being equipped with an MBA and consulting experience, she left to Silicon Valley to make her mark on the world. Listen to hear her story, her "framework" for how to think about your career, why she thinks being in silicon valley is a competitive advantage and how she pivoted her company from a failing startup to one of the most exciting startups of 2019.

      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/clawingbackfrom-250kdebtat20</link>
      <description>Aleks Svetski (@AleksSvetski) wanted to be a millionaire by 20... and he was on that path. He turned his $5K textbook money into more than $50,000 in the stock market! Until the 2008 global financial crisis hit... he didn't just lose all his money, he was negative quarter of a million. This setback ignited his entrepreneurial spirit where he started a door knocking hustle to get out his debt and make that cool million. Again, until the government betrayed his business and he went back to square one becoming a hippie on a sabbatical... and now he's back again with the lessons he's learned with his newfound passion: Bitcoin.

      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/using-1ktobuild-100mdeodorantbusiness</link>
      <description>Season 2 of The Hustle's podcast is here - and we're talking to Moiz Ali (@moizali). Have you ever looked at the back of your deodorant stick and read the ingredients? Aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex? PPG-14 Butyl Ether? Well, Moiz saw that and created Native, a natural deodorant without all the chemical junk. He built the company from his brother's dining table - doing sales, marketing, operations &amp; customer service as a one-man-show. His hard work paid off, as he sold the company for $100M to Proctor &amp; Gamble just 2.5 years after it launched. Listen in to hear the backstory of how he started using just $1k, how the company almost died (twice), and how he negotiated a $100M sale of the business!

      <title>#7 - The Hippie With A Billion Dollars</title>
      <link>https://play.acast.com/s/myfirstmillion/untitledepisode</link>
      <description>Michael Birch sold his social networking site to AOL for $850M....and then bought it back for $1M years later. (buy low, sell high. boys and girls). His business portfolio is impressive. He's an early investor in companies like Calm and Pinterest, owns two giant hotels, and bought a private island off of Richard Branson. Despite all that success, he's a down to earth guy, and in this podcast he talks through his early struggles and failed ideas before he had his billion dollar breakthrough and reminisces his days being head to head with Zuckerberg.
